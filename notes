Blog about making a blog.
This first article is about how i got this blog up and going.  The steps i used to make the website from scratch
and set up a home server to put it on the internet.
I will use this blog for future posts on other how to's or things I learn.  This blog will hopefully be as helpful
to me as it is for anyone else reading it.

All code used to make this blog will be at my github account: https://github.com/unsupo

First step is the make the website for the blog itself.  I could make it extremely simple, but as explained above
this is as much for me as it is for you.  So, i'll use new technologies to make it and incorporate any ideas
I can think of.

I'd like the blog to be edited by me in the browser so i can do it anywhere without the need to open the code
and commit changes, but all changes should be stored and saved preferably in my github account so any versioning
can be tracked.

Since many things in programming are on repeat, I'd like repeated processes to either have their own page with
a link in the current project or an accordion style way to open it in the current project.

The blog should be subdivided into languages then into projects.  So java, python, javascript, ect will all have
their own "folders".  Some will be in multiple folders due to some projects needed more than one language.  I'll
use metadata associated to each blog entry to assign it to folders automatically.  Once again all this should
be done from the browser so i don't needed to edit any code once completed.

A phone app would be helpful to me, but not exactly necessary.

ionic 2 works perfectly for the web, phone, and PWA or native desktop apps, so that will be the technology of
choice for the front end of the blog application.

I'd like a login, but by default everything is view only.  If you log you have access to create, edit, and
delete your blogs or blog entries.
